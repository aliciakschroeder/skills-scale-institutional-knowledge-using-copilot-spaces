# OctoAcme — Project Management Processes

This folder collects OctoAcme's project management process documents and templates used to run cross-functional projects. The goal is to give teams a consistent, lightweight way to move from idea to production while keeping stakeholders aligned, reducing risk, and continuously improving.

OctoAcme follows an iterative, customer-first lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close & Retrospective. Initiation uses a short Project One-pager to validate the problem, stakeholders, and success metrics. Planning breaks approved work into shippable increments and produces a prioritized backlog, estimates, a Definition of Done, and a release milestone map. Execution is run through a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) with a PR workflow that emphasizes small changes, linked acceptance criteria, CI checks, and at least one review before merging. Releases follow a checklist with pre-release verification, smoke tests, release notes, and rollback plans.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit: Project Managers coordinate delivery and communications, Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog, Developers implement and test, and QA validates acceptance criteria. Communication cadence includes daily standups, weekly PM+PdM syncs, regular demos, and milestone or weekly stakeholder updates. Risks and dependencies are tracked in a simple Risk Register and escalated along defined paths from team triage to sponsor-level when necessary.

Quality assurance combines automated and manual checks: unit and integration tests, CI security scans, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and manual QA for feature acceptance when needed. Retrospectives and continuous improvement are baked into the process — action items are tracked back into the backlog and reviewed in PM syncs to close the loop on process and product improvements. See the individual docs in this folder for templates, checklists, and detailed guidance.
